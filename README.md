## Description
This project draws inspiration from the foundations of Artificial Intelligence and seeks to help understand the high success of certain convolutional neural networks. The goal of this research is to determine the correlation between a popular CNN model and the visual ventral stream in the human brain. The human brain receives information from the retina to the V1 section of the occipital lobe. As the input continues to be processed, it moves to V2, V3, and eventually, to more complex regions of the brain.

One of the last regions is the Fusiform Face Area (FFA), which deciphers the face of the person someone is looking at and even includes information regarding their emotional responses. In this section of the brain, we are able to determine a personâ€™s and distinguish their mood: happy, sad, angry, neutral.

In this example, the popular CNN model, ResNet50, tested its ability to distinguish between the different emotional stimuli it has been trained on.

## Installation
Pull code from this repo
Install the faces database https://faces.mpdl.mpg.de/imeji/ and after registration, add the folder to the same directory as the main python file
