# Project Title

For the full documentation, please refer to the [README.pdf](README.pdf) file.

## Description
This project trains a ResNet50 with emotional stimuli by using faces with emotional stimuli such as anger, disgust, and neutral. Then, it seeks to find the Fusiform Face Area(FFA) correlate in the
convolutional neural network and determine if the CNN is able to map different emotional stimuli differently, just as the human FFA does

## Installation
Pull code from this repo
Install the faces database https://faces.mpdl.mpg.de/imeji/ after registration and add to the same directory as the main python file
